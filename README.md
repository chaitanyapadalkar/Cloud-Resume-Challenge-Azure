# Cloud-Resume-Challenge-Azure

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge project, Azure Edition! This project is designed to showcase my skills in cloud computing, web development, and DevOps using Microsoft Azure.

## Project Overview

### 1. Certification (AZ-900)
- Completed the AZ-900 certification, providing a solid foundation in Azure cloud concepts.

### 2. HTML and CSS
- Created a resume webpage using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

### 3. Static Website on Azure Storage
- Deployed the HTML resume as a static website using Azure Storage.

### 4. HTTPS with Azure CDN
- Enabled HTTPS for the Azure Storage website using Azure CDN for enhanced security.

### 5. DNS
- Configured a custom DNS domain name (e.g., my-c00l-resume-website.com) linked to the Azure CDN endpoint.

### 6. Javascript
- Implemented a visitor counter on the resume webpage using Javascript.

### 7. Database (CosmosDB)
- Utilized Azure CosmosDB's Table API to store and retrieve the visitor count.

### 8. API (Azure Functions)
- Created an API using Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger to interact with the CosmosDB database.

### 9. Python
- Wrote Python code for the Azure Function, exploring its use in back-end programming.

### 10. Tests
- Included tests for the Python code to ensure reliability and functionality.

### 11. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Defined API resources (Azure Function and CosmosDB) in an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, following the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principle.

### 12. Source Control (GitHub)
- Used GitHub for version control, allowing collaboration and history tracking.

### 13. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
- Implemented CI/CD workflows for both backend and frontend using GitHub Actions. Automatic testing, packaging, and deployment on every code change.

### 14. Blog Post
- Linked a in the resume, sharing insights and lessons learned during the project.
